# UART-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Program
Hello There, i'm someone how want turn Raspberry Pi Pico to a programmer UART but using assembly language,<br> here the video tutorial: https://youtu.be/4MqnW6pHDrY
Bootrom and Flash: https://youtu.be/w2w6onQakGQ
I need to get look at CPU Architectors and some knowlage about the CPU used "Dual-Core Arm Cortex-M0+" and datasheet of it get in the internet, i just want to try based on seeing a tutoriels on the YouTube and also want to read some PDF to understand the coding using for the communication UART. this page will update when i will get the information about the topic.

RP2040 Datasheet: 
Raspberry Pi Pico Datasheet:

Tools: (to convert into bin, and to compile to u2f format for Pico)

Thanks to <b>Will Thomas</b> for showing his applicant Baremetal on Pico
his youtube channel : https://youtube.com/@willth8

my object for that is to build a JTAG hardwaire wich is in Low Level programme to get closer and minimise the Error during  the extract to data (frimwaire)
